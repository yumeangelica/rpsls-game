# Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock

Originally developed in 2021, this Vanilla JavaScript project is a modern twist on the classic game Rock, Paper, Scissors. It includes additional elements - Lizard and Spock - to make the game more interesting and complex. The application allows users to play against the computer, track scores, and view game rules, all through a user-friendly interface. Developed using pure JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and Bootstrap, this project showcases foundational web development techniques without reliance on modern JavaScript frameworks or libraries.

I have made several improvements and decided to release it now.

- Option to select Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, or Spock.
